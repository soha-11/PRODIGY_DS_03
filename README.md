I have completed task-3 given to me during my internship as a data analyst with Prodigy InfoTech.
TASK_03 - Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
In the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI ML Repository, I applied advanced machine learning techniques to enhance predictive modeling.
